# Coachzone-Public

Coachzone is an IOS app I was contracted to build in the Summer of 2019. Over the course of 2.5 months, I independently built and shipped the app to the IOS app store. 

Video of the application can be seen at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk4iIGWHfNc&feature=youtu.be. 

Skills/Tools used:
- To ensure full control, the front-end is all Swift's Programatic Auto-Layout. 
- Node JS to create a REST API. 
- Several Redis Clusters for data caching.
- A Kafka Cluster to help distribute data across servers.
- Sockets with sticky sessions. 
- Server Auto-Scaling + Application Load Balancing
- Deployed a machine learning model to production through Docker and Plumber
- Social Login (Facebook + Google)
- Due to NDA, cannot share actual code.
